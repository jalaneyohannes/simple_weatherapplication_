### Reflection
This simple weather application was developed to demonstrate the integration of Java with an external API for retrieving real-time weather data. It provides users with a straightforward tool for accessing weather information for a specific city.

Weather applications are essential for users who need to stay informed about current weather conditions. By leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, this project showcases the capability of integrating external APIs into Java applications to enhance functionality.

From a technical standpoint, building this application required understanding HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and command-line interface development in Java. It provided valuable experience in working with APIs and handling data retrieval and processing.

The project highlights the importance of leveraging external APIs to enhance the capabilities of Java applications. By fetching real-time weather data, this application demonstrates the practical application of APIs in providing valuable information to users.

Through this project, I have gained insights into API integration, data parsing, and Java application development, reinforcing the significance of leveraging external resources to extend the functionality of software applications.
